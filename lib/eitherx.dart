/// `Either` is a generic class in Dart that represents a value of
/// one of two possible types: `L` or `R`. The class is useful when
/// you want to return a value that can either be of type `L` or of
/// type `R`, but not both.

/// This class is inspired by the Either data type in functional
/// programming and provides a way to handle errors and exceptions
/// in a more expressive and concise way.
